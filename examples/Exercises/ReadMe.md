This directory features templates for unsolved modeling tasks in SCCharts. These models are used as exercises in lecture on SCCharts.

The exercise provide a simulation visualization for the KIELER tool. When you simulate the main SCCharts the visualization will automatically start in the respective view of your IDE. If not please open this URL in your browser: http://localhost:5010/visualization

Each directory consist of the following files:
- *ReadMe.md* The description of the task.
- *<model>.sctx* The SCCharts file to specify the behavior.
- *<model>.environment.sctx* Predefined behavior to feed the simulation visualization. (Do not change this file)
- *<model>.svg* The graphics for the simulation visualization. (Do not change this file)
- *<model>.kviz* The glue code for the simulation visualization. (Do not change this file)
